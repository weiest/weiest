### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a fresh university graduate from Singapore, Information Systems with a major in Software Development.
I personally like working with Python and still learning on Javascript Frameworks.

Majority of my repositories are on my alternate github account (for my university work) and/or private, henceforth you will not find much here. Sorry bout that! ðŸ˜Š

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a **Associate Software Developer**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **solving problems that nobody has**, 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **try Twitter** 
- âš¡ Fun fact: **I'm suprisingly good at rhythm games.**
